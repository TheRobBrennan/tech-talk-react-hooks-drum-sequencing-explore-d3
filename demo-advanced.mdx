  title="Dockerfile for photo-share-api"
  showNumbers
  steps={[
    {}, // First step should be an overview of the snippet
    {lines: [1], notes: "Specify the base Node.js image"},
    {range: [6,7], notes: "Create the working directory on our process"},
    {range: [9,11], notes: "Copy and install our dependencies just like we would locally"},
    {range: [13,14], notes: "Copy our application code over"},
    {lines: [15], notes: "What is this? It seems a little...unusual."},
    {range: [17,19], notes: "We need to define ports for Docker to access"},
    {range: [21,22], notes: "This is the command to start our back-end server"},
    {}
  ]}

# Welcome

This project is intended to serve as a lightweight example for creating a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) - a freely available tool that allows you to build presentations using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.htmlreac), and [React](https://reactjs.org) components - presentation that can be deployed to [ZEIT Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

## Cheat sheet

```sh
// Step 1 - Verify your presentation is up and running
$ npm start

// Step 2 - Create `now.json` for deployment to ZEIT Now v2

// Step 3 - Deploy to ZEIT Now
$ npm run deploy

```

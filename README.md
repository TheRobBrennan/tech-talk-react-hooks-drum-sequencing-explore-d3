# Welcome
This project is intended to serve as a lightweight example for creating a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) - a freely available tool that allows you to build presentations using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.htmlreac), and [React](https://reactjs.org) components - presentation that can be deployed to [Zeit Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

You can view a [live demo](https://demo-mdxdeck-nowv2.now.sh) at [https://demo-mdxdeck-nowv2.now.sh](https://demo-mdxdeck-nowv2.now.sh)

# Welcome

This project was created for my presentation at GenUI on Thursday, May 30th, 2019.

You can [view](https://tech-talk-react-hooks-drum-sequencing-explore-d3.therobbrennan.now.sh/) the presentation at [https://tech-talk-react-hooks-drum-sequencing-explore-d3.therobbrennan.now.sh/](https://tech-talk-react-hooks-drum-sequencing-explore-d3.therobbrennan.now.sh/)

It was originally based on my lightweight example for creating a [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) - a freely available tool that allows you to build presentations using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.htmlreac), and [React](https://reactjs.org) components - presentation that can be deployed to [ZEIT Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

## Cheat sheet

```sh
// Step 1 - Verify your presentation is up and running
$ npm start

// Step 2 - Create `now.json` for deployment to ZEIT Now v2

// Step 3 - Deploy to ZEIT Now
$ npm run deploy

```
